</p>


### Usage

To use the new commands:

1. Put the `responseletter.sty` file into the root folder of a latex project.
2. Add `\usepackage{responseletter}` in the preamble of the main file of the project.


### Commands

* `\reviewer{review prologue}{thanks}`

Usually the review of a reviewer starts with a prologue that summarizes the work and its main strenghts and drawbacks.
After this part it is usually good practice to thank the reviewer for her/his feedbacks.

This command creates a title 'Reviewer \<num\>' using the \Large font size and prints *review prologue* in italic and *thanks* in red color.
If thanks is empty it prints 'We thank Reviewer <num>...' as placeholder.

* `\comment{the comment}{answer}`

For each comment provided by a reviewer is good norm to provide a proper answer.
This command prints a title 'Comment \<Reviewer num\>.\<Comment num\>' in bold, it then prints the comment in italic and the answer in red color.

* `\curreviewer`

This command prints the current reviewer name as 'Reviewer \<num\>'

### Example Usage

The example letter depicted in the picture at the beginning of this document is generated by the following code.

```latex
